# Sentry Production Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Variables Configured

- `SENTRY_DSN` - Backend monitoring (Node.js project)
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Frontend monitoring (React project)
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection

### ✅ Sentry Features Enabled for Production

#### Frontend Monitoring (React Project)

- **Performance Tracking**: Page load times, Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **Error Boundary**: React component error catching with user-friendly
  fallbacks
- **Session Replay**: User interaction recordings for debugging
  (privacy-optimized)
- **Browser Profiling**: Performance bottleneck identification
- **User Feedback**: Built-in feedback widget for user error reports
- **Route Tracking**: Single-page application navigation monitoring
- **Resource Monitoring**: CSS, JavaScript, image loading performance
- **Contact Form Tracking**: Enhanced error context and user journey mapping

#### Backend Monitoring (Node.js Project)

- **API Performance**: HTTP request/response times and throughput
- **Database Monitoring**: PostgreSQL query performance and errors
- **Express Integration**: Route-level performance and error tracking
- **File System Monitoring**: I/O operations and performance
- **Console Logging**: Enhanced server-side logging with context
- **Memory & CPU Tracking**: Server resource utilization
- **Local Variables**: Enhanced debugging with variable capture
- **Error Context**: Rich error metadata including user sessions

### ✅ Production Optimizations Applied

- **Sample Rates**: Optimized for cost efficiency (20% performance, 10%
  profiling)
- **Error Filtering**: Common browser errors and dev-only issues excluded
- **Privacy Compliance**: PII masking, secure data handling
- **Release Tracking**: Version-based error attribution
- **Environment Tagging**: Production vs development separation
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient data transmission and storage

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check environment variables are set
echo $SENTRY_DSN
echo $VITE_SENTRY_DSN
echo $NODE_ENV
```

### 2. Build for Production

The existing build process is already configured:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy to Replit

- Replit autoscale deployment is configured
- Environment variables are automatically included
- Health check endpoint available at `/api/health`

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Monitor Sentry Dashboards

1. **React Project Dashboard**: Frontend errors, performance, user sessions
2. **Node.js Project Dashboard**: API errors, database issues, server
   performance

#### Key Metrics to Watch

- **Error Rate**: Should be <1% for production traffic
- **Performance Score**: Web Vitals should be in "Good" range
- **Database Queries**: Monitor for slow queries or connection issues
- **Memory Usage**: Backend memory consumption trends
- **User Sessions**: Session duration and interaction patterns

### 5. Set Up Alerts

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)

- Database connection failures
- 5XX error rate > 5%
- Frontend crash rate > 2%
- API response time > 5 seconds

#### Warning Alerts (24h Response)

- Error rate increase > 50%
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Database query time > 2 seconds
