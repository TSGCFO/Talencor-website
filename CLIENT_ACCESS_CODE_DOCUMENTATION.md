# Client Access Code System - Complete Guide

<!-- <DocumentationOverviewSnippet> -->
<!-- This document explains how the Client Access Code system works -->
<!-- Think of it like a VIP pass at a concert - existing clients get special treatment -->
<!-- </DocumentationOverviewSnippet> -->

## What is the Client Access Code System?

<!-- <SimpleExplanationSnippet> -->
The Client Access Code system is like giving your best customers a special membership card. 

Imagine you run a coffee shop:
- New customers have to fill out a loyalty card application
- But regular customers just show their membership number
- The cashier instantly knows who they are and their usual order

That's exactly what our access code system does for job postings!
<!-- </SimpleExplanationSnippet> -->

## How Does It Work?

<!-- <StepByStepProcessSnippet> -->
### For Existing Clients:

1. **They Get a Special Code**
   - Each client company receives a unique 8-character code
   - Example: "ACME2025" for Acme Corporation
   - It's like their personal fast-pass

2. **They Enter the Code**
   - On the job posting form, there's an orange box at the top
   - They type their code and click "Verify Code"
   - It's as simple as entering a coupon code when shopping online

3. **Magic Happens!**
   - Their company information automatically fills in:
     - Company name
     - Contact person's name
     - Email address
     - Phone number
   - They can still edit if anything needs updating

4. **Their Job Gets Priority**
   - Instead of starting at "new" status
   - Their job jumps straight to "contacted" status
   - It's like skipping the line at the DMV!
<!-- </StepByStepProcessSnippet> -->

## Test Access Codes

<!-- <TestCodesSnippet> -->
For testing the system, we have three example companies ready to use:

| Company Name | Access Code | Contact Person |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Acme Corporation | ACME**** | (Check database) |
| Tech Solutions Inc | TECH**** | (Check database) |
| Global Manufacturing Ltd | GLOB**** | (Check database) |

**Note:** The full access codes are masked for security. The actual codes follow the pattern shown in the seed script.
<!-- </TestCodesSnippet> -->

## How the Code Works (Technical Details in Simple Terms)

<!-- <DatabaseStructureSnippet> -->
### The Client List (Database Table: `clients`)

Think of this as our VIP customer list. For each client, we store:
- **Company Name**: The business name (like "Acme Corporation")
- **Contact Name**: The main person we talk to (like "John Smith")
- **Email**: Their email address for communications
- **Phone**: Their phone number (optional)
- **Access Code**: Their special VIP code (unique for each company)
- **Is Active**: Whether they're still a current client (yes/no)
- **Created Date**: When they became a client
- **Updated Date**: When we last updated their information
<!-- </DatabaseStructureSnippet> -->

<!-- <APIEndpointExplanationSnippet> -->
### The Verification Process (API Endpoint: `/api/verify-client`)

When someone enters an access code, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **The Request**
   - The form sends the access code to our server
   - It's like handing your membership card to the cashier

2. **The Lookup**
   - The server checks if this code exists in our client list
   - And makes sure the client is still active
   - Like checking if a gift card is valid and has balance

3. **The Response**
   - If valid: Send back all the client's information
   - If invalid: Send back an error message
   - The form then either fills in the data or shows an error
<!-- </APIEndpointExplanationSnippet> -->

<!-- <FormIntegrationSnippet> -->
### How It Appears on the Job Posting Form

The access code section is designed to be user-friendly:

1. **Visual Design**
   - Orange background to stand out
   - Clear heading: "Existing Client?"
   - Helpful text explaining what to do

2. **Input Field**
   - A text box for entering the code
   - A "Verify Code" button next to it
   - Shows a spinning circle while checking

3. **Success Feedback**
   - Green checkmark when verified
   - Message: "Client verified - Your information has been auto-filled"
   - All fields populate automatically

4. **Error Handling**
   - Red toast notification for invalid codes
   - User can try again or continue without a code
   - Form still works normally either way
<!-- </FormIntegrationSnippet> -->

## Benefits of the System

<!-- <BenefitsListSnippet> -->
### For Existing Clients:
- **Saves Time**: No need to type company details again
- **Fewer Errors**: Information is always correct
- **Faster Service**: Jobs get processed immediately
- **Feel Valued**: VIP treatment for loyal customers

### For Talencor Staff:
- **Efficiency**: Less manual data entry
- **Accuracy**: Client info is always up-to-date
- **Priority Queue**: Know which jobs to handle first
- **Better Relationships**: Clients appreciate the convenience
<!-- </BenefitsListSnippet> -->

## Security Features

<!-- <SecurityMeasuresSnippet> -->
The system includes several security measures:

1. **Unique Codes**: Each client has a different code
2. **Active Status Check**: Inactive clients can't use old codes
3. **Server-Side Validation**: All checks happen on the secure server
4. **No Sensitive Data in Codes**: Codes don't contain personal information
5. **Masked Display**: Only show first 4 characters when listing codes
<!-- </SecurityMeasuresSnippet> -->

## Admin Management

<!-- <AdminFeaturesSnippet> -->
### Viewing Job Postings

Administrators can see all job postings at `/admin/job-postings` where they can:
- See which postings came from verified clients
- Filter by status (new, contacted, etc.)
- Update job posting status
- View complete submission details

### Managing Clients

Currently, client management requires database access. Future enhancements will include:
- Admin interface for adding new clients
- Ability to deactivate clients
- Access code generation and management
- Client activity reports
<!-- </AdminFeaturesSnippet> -->

## Testing the System

<!-- <TestingGuideSnippet> -->
To test the Client Access Code system:

1. **Go to the Job Posting Page**
   - Navigate to `/post-job`
   - You'll see the orange "Existing Client?" section

2. **Try a Test Code**
   - Enter one of the test access codes
   - Click "Verify Code"
   - Watch the form auto-populate

3. **Submit a Test Job**
   - Fill in the job details
   - Submit the form
   - Check the admin panel to see it has "contacted" status

4. **Test Error Cases**
   - Try an invalid code like "WRONG123"
   - See the error message appear
   - Verify the form still works without a code
<!-- </TestingGuideSnippet> -->

## Common Questions

<!-- <FAQSnippet> -->
**Q: What if a client forgets their access code?**
A: They can still post jobs normally. Contact Talencor to retrieve their code.

**Q: Can access codes be changed?**
A: Yes, through database updates. Future versions will have a UI for this.

**Q: What happens if someone shares their code?**
A: Each submission is logged. Unusual activity can be investigated.

**Q: Do codes expire?**
A: Currently no. Codes remain valid until the client is deactivated.

## Code Examples

<!-- <CodeExampleSnippet> -->
### How to Add a New Client (Database Command)

```sql
-- This is like adding a new VIP member to your club
INSERT INTO clients (
  company_name,      -- The business name
  contact_name,      -- Who we talk to
  email,            -- Their email
  phone,            -- Their phone (optional)
  access_code,      -- Their special code
  is_active         -- Are they current? (true/false)
) VALUES (
  'New Company Inc',
  'Jane Doe',
  'jane@newcompany.com',
  '555-0123',
  'NEWC2025',
  true
);
```

### How to Check if a Code Works (API Test)

```bash
# This is like testing if a gift card is valid
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/verify-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"accessCode": "ACME2025"}'

# You'll get back either:
# Success: {"success": true, "client": {...company details...}}
# Error: {"success": false, "message": "Invalid access code"}
```
